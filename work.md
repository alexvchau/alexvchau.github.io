We are currently running a new large volume cosmological hydrodymical simulation with 2 x 5500<sup>3</sup> particles in 250 Mpc/h volume box on Frontera supercomputer. The simulation includes new implementations of supermassive black hole physics, stellar metal return model and reionization models. It will provide us an ideal suite to study the formation and evolution of galaxies and SMBHs at z>2.

Abstract:
The National Basketball Association (NBA) has always been about gaining a competitive edge over
opponents. With the increased awareness and emphasis in analytics, the NBA’s shift toward data-driven
efficiency has changed everything from team composition to shot selection. NBA data from the past 10 
seasons was evaluated to identify where and how efficiency changes have taken place tosee analytics in action.

My research has identified significant changes in how players decide where to shoot the ball based on the
differences in the expected points per shot. Determined by average shooting percentages, the most efficient
shots to take in the modern NBA are close 2-point shots (0-3 feet) and 3-point shots (22-23.75 feet+). Given
that the NBA has been pushing toward analytics with the rise of “stats geeks” like Daryl Morey of the
Philadelphia 76ers implementing their own data-driven systems, it is no surprise the league has evolved to
accept these changes over the past 10 years.

From the data analyzed, there is proof the mid-range 2-point shot has been heavily phased out of the arsenal
of players in the NBA as the demand for 3-point sharpshooters has increased over the past few years. Even
for players that are used in the “Center” position (which has notoriously represented the worst shooters in
the league), the modern day Center in the NBA is increasingly becoming a player that can also down 3-
point shots. As the 3-point shot increases in popularity, the rise in efficiency follows. This data signifies the
NBA is constantly changing and adapting to new tactics as competition only become more cutthroat.
